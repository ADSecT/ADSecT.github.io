- Researchers have proposed a variety of novel attacks against DNN models for computer vision [3, 21, 27, 33, 34, 54, 58], natural language processing [5, 10, 44, 60], reinforcement learning [25, 53, 65], etc. <u>However, there are no studies investigating the backdoor opportunity against the lane detection systems.</u>

  - **备注：** 研究人员已经对CV、RL、NLP等领域提出了后门攻击的方法，然而还没有调查对车道线检测系统的后门攻击相关的研究。【新方法用在老场景中】
- Besides, <u>the physical triggers used to attack face classification models cannot be applied to lane detection</u> due to the semantic differences between these two scenarios.  The physical triggers need to be carefully redesigned.

  - **备注：** 此外，攻击人脸分类模型所使用的物理触发器，由于两种场景的语义差异，无法应用于车道检测。物理触发器需要仔细地重新设计。【介绍与已有方法的不同之处】
